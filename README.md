# LeaveInstanceNowWowAddon

For those that are soloing and need to leave the instance in a hurry, this is what you need. This addon will help you list a group and so you can leave it and be teleported out of an instance.

You can use the CopyToAddonFolder.ps1 file to copy the newest files into your addons directory. You can override the default Addons directory path using the -addonsFolderPath parameter when running the script.

(Optional)
* Create a macro for leaving party
> /script LeaveParty()

## How to Use
* Use the slash commmand "/lin" to open the Premade Groups -> Custom -> Start a Group screen
* Type in a title and press enter to list group

Once you have done this, leave party and wait to be teleported out.
